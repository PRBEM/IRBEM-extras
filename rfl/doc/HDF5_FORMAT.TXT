Information on HDF5 format 3-D response files.

The Response Function Library 3-D response files contain tabulated
responses for each energy channel and one or more species. These are
provided in hierarchical form in the HDF5 files (or CDF or .mat save
sets). For HDF5 format 3-D response files (.h5 extension) produced by
Matlab, the following information can be helpful:

HDF5 does not store strings. So, strings are stored in UTF-8 encoding
as uint8 data. String variables have an attribute isString.

Boolean variables are stored as uint8 and have an attribute isBoolean.

Matlab stores arrays of strings as "cell arrays" these are captured in
HDF5 as groups with an isArray attribute. Members of the group have
variable names 0, 1, 2, ...

Most of the data are stored in groups and sub-groups, with isStruct
attribute set.

Matlab treats all variables as double precision and matrix by
default. So, even scalars will have size 1x1, and many integers will
be stored as double precision.
