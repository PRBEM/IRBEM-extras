The "extras" folder contains developer-contributed packages that have
not yet been (and may never be) integrated into the main irbem/trunk.

These packages will tend not to have the same level of documentation,
inter-version compatibility, Makefile, and installation that is
provided in the main irbem library.

As of 24 February, the "extras" contains 3 packages:

var2cdf - IDL and Matlab routines to support sharing of structured
data and save sets between Matlab and IDL via NASA's CDF format. These
are still a bit of a work in progress, especially the IDL code. POC:
Paul O'Brien.

nnlib - a neural network library in C, with Matlab wrapper. Requires
Gnu Scientific Library (GSL, http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). POC:
Paul O'Brien.

invlib - an inversion library in C for spectral inversion and
pitch-angle inversion of space particle data. Some Matlab and IDL
examples/wrappers are provided. Requires GSL and nnlib. POC: Paul
O'Brien.

kdtree - a C library for building and accessing k-dimensional
trees. These are handy for finding nearest neighbors in a Pythagorean
or maximum coordinate distance sense.

rfl - Response Function Library, a set of routines to perform standard
tasks relating to the response function of idealized and simulated
instruments.
