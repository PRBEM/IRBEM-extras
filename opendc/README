The goal of OpenDC is to provide a central repository for validated
codes that compute the diffusion coefficients widely used in radiation
belt physics. Unlike the main IRBEM-LIB, many OpenDC routines may
exist only in one high-level language.

matlab/Daa_FA_local.m the local angle and momentum diffusion
coefficients for gyroresonant interactions with parallel-propagating
waves in a proton plasma, following Summers 2005.

matlab/Sheeley2001.m - the plasmasphere/trough density model of
Sheeley 2001.
